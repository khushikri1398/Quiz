        <h2>Gameplay for part 2</h2>
        
        <div class="rules">
            <h3>1. Question Selection:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A set of questions will be displayed on the screen, categorized by different topics, and each topic consists of 6 questions. Each question has a point value, and the higher the points, the tougher the challenges..</li>
                <li>Participants will choose a topic and then select a question based on its point value.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Answering Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The team answering the question correctly will earn the points assigned to that question and will have the opportunity to select and answer the next question.</li>
                <li>If the team answers incorrectly, they will incur a negative marking as specified.</li>
                <li>
                    The question will be visible on the screen for 45 seconds. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chits will be distributed to determine who starts the game and selects a question. A team member from each team will come up to pick a chit, which will contain either the number 0 or 1. If they draw the number 1, they will have the opportunity to select the question.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You'll choose a question based on its point value. If you answer correctly, youâ€™ll earn those points and will have the opportunity to select and answer the next question.
                    When questions are displayed on the screen,at that time any team can answer the question. The team who presses the buzzer first will have the chance to answer the question.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    If the team will give the right answer then he will get the opportunity to select the next question also.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Otherwise, the chance to choose the question will go back to the team that selected it before.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer incorrectly or if the team presses the buzzer first but doesn't provide an answer, the team will lose points according to our negative marking scheme.
